The smallest within-between ration is of BOW representation. Yes, this is what I expected because BOG is calcculated after extracting features, whereas others are calcuated directly by pixels. Pixels of same animals can be very very different. It varies with illumilation, translation of objects. So directly comparining pixel by pixel is wrong, and more abstraction of features are required which is been taken care by BOG. 
The best descriptor is BOW and it is the smallest. The in class distance should be minimized whereas the out-class distance should be maximized for a good classifcation. Hence, the ratio of in-class by out-class should be as small as possible. Hence, BOW is best.
